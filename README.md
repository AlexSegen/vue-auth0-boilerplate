# Vue Auth0 boilerplate

  
This repository contains a basic Vue Js application that shows how to add authentication to it by using the free Auth0 service. It has three routes so the users can login, logout and view their profile.


## Get started

First, you need to create an account at auth0.com and create a new Application, then get its connection data. Finally,  you need to rename the .env,example file and fill it.

The app will use localStorage to "save" current session and mantein persistence within navigation.

Feel free to ask any question.
